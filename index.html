        <h1>Learn the ways of the Danaher Death Squad for Free</h1>
        <p>I have created a collection of the most useful Danaher Death Squad videos on Youtube for your development. 
        They are ordered sequentially for the beginner getting started in the sport. I, and others, have made incredibly quick progress with this path.
        Know what you are doing.
        Invisible Jiu Jitsu is a nebulous, meaningless term designed to scare you. Soon you will be able to defeat your training partners with ease.

        <p>Below is a Table of all the essential videos. The rows represent a theme and the columns represent specific technique(s).</p>
        <p>The rows are ordered top-down for your development. John Danaher has stated it is crucial to build your game ground-up as a beginner. You start with escapes, retention, move 
            to half guard, full guard, until you are on your feet. Submission attacks can be learned during this process but come secondary to the positional game. Danaher only teaches experts 
            submissions first, much like how experienced chess players study the end-game.
